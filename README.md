- It converts quotes to speech
- It also utilizes my custom [api](authors.json)
- It uses debounce when generating Quotes for 2secs

## Technologies, Languages and Tools Used

## Why I used them

I used the Tech Stack above to keep things simple and fix bugs easily

## Challenges I faced

- First of all this whole App was not what I planned to build for the Hackathon

- The App is not very responsive
